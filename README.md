# PatternScan-NTDLL-LdrFunctions
This repository contains code for a pattern scanning tool designed to locate specific functions within the ntdll.dll library of the Windows operating system. Specifically, it searches for the addresses of LdrLoadDll and LdrpLoadDllInternal, which are core functions responsible for loading dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) within the Windows kernel.
